# What is this repository?

Just some collection of assembly stuff.

# Directories.

./NASM contains Intel's syntax of x86-64 assembly, while ./gcc contains AT&T's syntax of x86-64 assembly.

./conversion is just gcc converting C to x86-64 assembly with optimizations.

# Inefficiency disclaimer!

This code is quite inefficient. Do not copy my code if you want to be efficient (which is probably the reason why you're studying assembly anyway.)
